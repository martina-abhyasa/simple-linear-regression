# Simple Linear Regression

Regression analysis techniques help uncover relationships between variables. Regression analysis leads to a selection of a model that expresses how one or more independent variables can be used to predict the value of another variable, called the dependent variable. 

Simple linear regression models use a single numerical independent variable (x), to predict the numerical dependent variable (y). 
Using fundamentals of C#, we create the methods that compute values such as regression coefficients, the sample intercept (a), and the sample slope(b). 
The resulting output describes the strength and the direction of the linear relationship and also includes a computed linear regression model, in the form Å·  = a + bx.
